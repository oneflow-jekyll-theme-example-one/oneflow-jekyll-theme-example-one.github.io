<h1>Basics: Recipe Recommender - My Bachelor Thesis</h1>

My bachelor thesis investigated the effectiveness of algorithms for personalized recipe recommendations. The research tested whether collaborative filtering or content-based approaches yield more satisfying results in terms of matching usersâ€™ taste. To achieve this, a software application was developed, implementing both ItemKNN and content-based algorithm, allowing for a direct comparison of their recommendation outcomes.

    <h4>ItemKNN / Collaborative Filtering <i class="fa fa-trophy"></i></h4>
    <p>Analyzing the results revealed a statistically significant difference in user ratings, with the ItemKNN algorithm receiving higher average ratings (4.2 out of 5 stars) compared to the content-based algorithm (3.389 stars). This suggests that, on average, users found the recommendations provided by the ItemKNN algorithm more appealing and satisfying. The study thus underlines the effectiveness of collaborative filtering approaches in the context of personalized recipe recommendations.</p>

<h1>Software architecture</h1>

The architecture of the Recipe Recommender system was documented with parts of the

I used the <a href="https://canvas.arc42.org/architecture-communication-canvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">arc42 Architecture Communication Canvas</a>
    to give a brief overview of the software architecture.<br><br>
